	<h1>People in New York City are Getting the Short End of The Stick</h1>

	<h4>The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), an independent city agency,takes too long to resolve compliants filed on NYPD police officers.</h4>
<br>
	<p>After the police killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor in 2020, police agencies across the country had to interface with protests against police misconduct. While the number of complaints went down by an average of 9% over the next two years, they increased by 19% by the end of 2023, surpassing the pandemic complaints in 2020.
When someone files a complaint, an investigator talks to the complainant and any witnesses, collects evidence, and tries to identify the police officers involved. However, the process is slow, especially because the NYPD takes a long time to provide information to the CCRB, causing investigations to take an average of 317 to 430 days to finish. Although the CCRB has addressed the issue, the NYPD administrative office blames staff shortages for the delays.
Many people do not trust any law enforcement agency. They often worry about retaliation, especially if the incident happened in their neighborhood, and they believe that the process is unfair and favors the police.

<p>The increase in complaints across the five boroughs is in the same order as the crime statistics, with Brooklyn taking the lead, Manhattan being second, and the Bronx being third. The CCRB needs the complainants' cooperation to conduct full investigations.

	<p>The long and complicated process, which requires complainants to participate in multiple interviews and court dates, adds to their frustration. NYPD Officer Oscar Montesdeoca said, “Many of the complaints are discarded because of the lengthy process. Complainants get tired of waiting and may be unable to take several days off from work or arrange childcare to participate in the many layers of the initial investigation or the appeal process.”The CCRB needs the complainants' cooperation to conduct full investigations. Without their help, many cases are closed because the complainants are unavailable, uncooperative, or withdraw their complaints</p>

	<p>As New Yorkers continue to demand accountability, the CCRB faces the challenge of restoring trust in its ability to effectively oversee the NYPD.</p>
